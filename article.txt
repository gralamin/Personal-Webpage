My Personal Webpage source code.  This article mostly exists as a link page and
test page.  Below is some text that should be automatically parsed. Below it,
you may see a 'show source' button. Clicking on that should reveal the page source.

Double Newlines should be used to determine new divs. *This text should be
bolded*. /This text should
be italizied/. _and this should
be underlined_.
New lines (inserted inside the text) should not interfere with its display.

{style: 'color: red'} This paragraph should be in red text.

* List item 1
* List item 2

# Numbered list 1
# Numbered list 2

Finally have a link back to the [index|Home Page]. Or perhaps to this article [article=1].
